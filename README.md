# imdb-searcher

**made using python IMDbPy

**The aim of this project is to randomly generate a movie suggestion based on user selection. 

**main options:
```
- movie genre
- movie year (optional)
- rating (best or worst ratings)
```


as a little joke, the code tends to suggest the movie "Die Hard" even when the user selects another a genre/year different from it.
